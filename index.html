                <h2>Garbage Cat</h2>
                <p>There is a cat in my neighborhood who likes to hang out in my yard. <br>
                    I suspect that this is because I have really good <span id="changecolor-weight">garbage</span>
                    <br>
                    I have come home to find my trash can looted through several times. Once, it was for half of a
                    donut. <br>
                    I know this because it was the only thing in there. <br>
                    I've taken to calling it "Garbage". It is black, fluffy, and cross-eyed. </p>

            <h2>Peanut Butter</h2>
            <p>I have a tremendously absurd relationship with peanut butter. I could eat it until the sheer
                quantity
                killed me. <br>
                I don't know why, but if there is an open jar in the house I can hear its siren-song
                constantly.
                <br>
                And, foolishly, I go. A <span id="changecolor-weight">sailor</span> to the rocks.<br>
                Drowning before I'm even aware that the sweet sweet singing has stopped.</p>

            <h2>The Sun</h2>
            <p>I have become wholly convinced that it is going to <span id="changecolor-weight">rain</span>
                forever.<br>
                That's okay. If the sun never shines again, Garbage the Cat and I can live off of peanut
                butter.</p>

            <h2>Stigmata</h2>
            <p>Once, when I was maybe ten years old, my best friends and I were playing in my yard. <br>
                Brooke, my friend, tripped and fell into a holly bush and emerged with perfect <span id="changecolor-weight">stigmata</span>
                markings. <br>
                Hands, feet, head, the whole ordeal. The very best part is that we didn't tell her deeply
                religious
                mother what happened when she came to pick her up.<br>
                I think we maybe caved and told her after about 30 minutes.
            </p>
